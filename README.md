# 🌐 SIMULATION CONTROLLING EMBEDDED SYSTEM WITH PROTEUS, C# AND ARDUINO

This project simulates controlling an Embedded System using **Proteus**, **C#**, and **Arduino**.

- 🛠️ **Proteus** is used to design the virtual embedded system, including components such as LEDs, microcontrollers, LCDs, and other peripheral devices.
- 💻 The control interface is developed in **C#** as a Desktop Application, which communicates with the system via **virtual COM ports** using the **RS232 protocol**.
- ⚙️ The embedded firmware is written in **Arduino language (C/C++)** and uploaded to a virtual Arduino in Proteus to simulate the behavior of a real embedded controller.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 💻 Visual Studio (C#)
- 🎨 Proteus Design Suite
- 🔌 Arduino IDE (Embedded code)
- 📡 RS232 Serial Communication (Virtual COM)
